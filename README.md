# SQL Portfolio: Business Database Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of SQL for business analysis and operational data management. It includes structured queries to explore customer behavior and sales trends, as well as advanced SQL features like views, indexing, and triggers to enhance performance and data integrity.

## 1. Business Queries (Module 7)

These queries analyze a bookstore-style customer and sales database:

- Customers who did not make purchases on specific dates
- Books acquired before certain years with calculated discounts
- Sale and price summaries using aggregation and subqueries
- Use of `PARTITION BY` for windowed calculations
- Extraction of phone number area codes

## 2. Views, Indexes, and Triggers (Module 8)

- `CustomerOrderSummary` view to track order history and spending
- Index creation to improve lookup performance on employee names
- An audit trigger to log employee deletions into a tracking table

➡File: `views_and_triggers.sql`

## Technologies
- SQL (MySQL-compatible syntax)
- Views, Triggers, Indexes
- Aggregations, Subqueries, Filtering

Built from academic coursework on relational databases to demonstrate both foundational and applied SQL knowledge.
