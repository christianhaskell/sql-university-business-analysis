-- Step 1: Create the audit table \
CREATE TABLE employee_audit (\
    auditID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\
    employeeNumber INT,\
    lastName VARCHAR(50),\
    firstName VARCHAR(50),\
    jobTitle VARCHAR(50),\
    email VARCHAR(100),\
    deletedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\
);\
\
-- Step 2: Create the trigger\
DELIMITER //\
CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_delete\
AFTER DELETE ON employees\
FOR EACH ROW\
BEGIN\
    INSERT INTO employee_audit (employeeNumber, lastName, firstName, jobTitle, email)\
    VALUES (OLD.employeeNumber, OLD.lastName, OLD.firstName, OLD.jobTitle, OLD.email);\
END;\
//\
DELIMITER ;\
\
-- Step 3: Delete employees 1076 & 1143 (if they exist)\
DELETE FROM employees WHERE employeeNumber = 1076;\
DELETE FROM employees WHERE employeeNumber = 1143;\
\
-- Step 4: Verify if the deleted employees were logged\
SELECT * FROM employee_audit ORDER BY deletedAt DESC LIMIT 5;\
